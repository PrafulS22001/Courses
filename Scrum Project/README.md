# Scrum project 

My observations were pretty straight forward. Scrum project helps the owner and the development team (including scrum master) come to a mutual aggrement about a project. Rephrasing it differently, it simply means that this project has maade me realize how helpful this method is. Scrum helps the owner achieve their ambition more realistically and more accuratey and easily as well.

I would say almost everything went well. As i was acting as the dev team, my roles were pretty less so i wasn't frequently involved. In the beginning, we overthought everything from the project to the backlog and everything. We overcomplicated everything and took more time and energy than we actually needed. I wouldn't say this was wrong because it helped us understand this method even more thoroughly. 
<br> 
Our team i believe succeded in almost accurate sprint planning and estimates. We didn't have much problems. 
<br> 
The product owner was kinda handful. They wanted kindof a complicated project and always wanted to change even a minute details till the last sprint. This gave the development team a lot to work on and for a long time.

Scrum as a project management method is easy to understand. It's iteration upon iteration. In this method, the development team changes after each sprint. They first get the rough idea and finalize it. Then after looking at the drawbacks and features, then only the development starts taking shape. And in each sprint, the project goes to further development if the scrum master rejcects it. And after it get's through them, then only the customer/owner sees it. So, i found it eeffective and less time consuming.

One scrum project includes mainly of 3 roles.<BR> Owner/cutomer: This person owns the project, he/she has the idea to start the project and they are the one who has the most say in this project. 
<br> Scrum master : They are part of the development team but they are more experienced. Their main role is to communicate betweem dev team and customer to see what can and cannot be done. They also help in the development process. 
<br> Development team: They are the final line. They are the one that actually bring the idea to reality. The svrum master gets the idea and relays it to the dev team and they have a meeting on whether they can or cannot do the things owner wants us to do. They are involved in the sprint as well.
